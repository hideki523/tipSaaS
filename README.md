## WingtipSaaS
Wingtip Tickets Platform sample SaaS application and management scripts.

This project provides a sample SaaS application that embodies many common SaaS patterns that can be used with Azure SQL Database.  The sample is based on an event-management and ticket-selling scenario for small venues.  Each venue is a 'tenant' of the SaaS application.  The sample uses a database-per-tenant model, with a database created for each venue.  These databases are hosted in elastic database pools to provide easy performance management, and to cost-effectively accommodate the unpredictable usage patterns of these small venues and their customers.  An additional catalog database holds the mapping between tenants and their databases.  This mapping is managed using the Shard Map Management features of the Elastic Scale Client Library.  

The basic application, which includes three pre-defined databases for three venues, can be installed in your Azure subscription under a single ARM resource group.  To uninstall the application, delete the resource group from the Azure Portal. 

NOTE: if you install the application you will be charged for the Azure resources created.  Actual costs incurred are based on your subscription offer type but are nominal if the application is not scaled up unreasonably and is deleted promptly after you have finished exploring the tutorials.

More information about the sample app and the associated tutorials is here: [https://aka.ms/sqldbsaastutorial](https://aka.ms/sqldbsaastutorial)

Also available in the Documentation folder in this repo is an **overview presentation** that provides background, explores alternative database models for multi-tenant apps, and walks through several of the SaaS patterns at a high level. There is also a demo script you can use with the presentation to give others a guided tour of the app and several of the patterns.

To deploy the app to Azure, click the link below.  Deploy the app in a new resource group, and provide a short *user* value that will be appended to several resource names to make them globally unique.  Your initials and a number is a good pattern to use.

After deployment completes, launch the app by browsing to ```http://events.wtp.USER.trafficmanager.net```, substituting *USER* with the value you set during deployment.
